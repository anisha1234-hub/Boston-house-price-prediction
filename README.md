This project uses the Boston Housing dataset to build predictive models that estimate house prices based on various features such as location, crime rate, number of rooms, and property tax.

1. Performed data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
2. Implemented and compared multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting
3. Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score
4. Visualized important features affecting house prices using matplotlib and seaborn

This project was developed during my AI/ML internship at ShadowFox, focusing on real-world application of regression techniques.

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
